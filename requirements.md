At Nataliya Foundation, we are focused on helping people affected by the on-going crisis in Ukraine. We are a non-sectarian, non-political and non-profit making organization.

##1) We currently have a volunteer registration page in pdf and will like to integrate it into the website as a web page where volunteers can register directly on the website and have their data saved on a backend. We will also like to set up a provision where potential volunteers can upload their photos to our website. Where students seeking grants can apply. And where Elders seeking care can reach out to us.

#Admin portal
-to view volunteers RUD
-add locations to Google map CRUD
-add videos / interviews / successes or campaings CRUD

##2) Nataliya Foundation is working at setting up collection center locations around the united states, and will like our site updated to show the locations of these centers so that donors can find it easy dropping off donations. And a facility to allow us send news letter to registered members. However, there are currently no locations in the united states, but it's worth mentioning so as to help you negotiate your rate.



##3) We will like to redirect our contact page to send emails directly to us.

##4) Some pages where certain Videos of events can be seen, and some interviews as well heard, where stories of your successes and achievements can be shared.
