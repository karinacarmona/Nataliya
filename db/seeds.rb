# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' , { name: 'Copenhagen' ])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

4.5. Populating the Database with seeds.rb
With the file db/seeds.rb, the Rails gods have given us a way of feeding default values easily and quickly to a fresh installation. This is a normal Ruby program within the Rails environment. You have full access to all classes and methods of your application.
So you do not need to enter everything manually with rails console in order to make the records created in the section called “create” available in a new Rails application, but you can simply use the following file db/seeds.rb:
Country.create(name: 'Germany', population: 81831000)
Country.create(name: 'France', population: 65447374)
Country.create(name: 'Belgium', population: 10839905)
Country.create(name: 'Netherlands', population: 16680000)
You then populate it with data via rake db:seed. To be on the safe side, you should always set up the database from scratch with rake db:setup in the context of this book and then automatically populate it with the file db/seeds.rb. Here is what is looks like:
$ rake db:setup
db/development.sqlite3 already exists
-- create_table, :force=>true)
   -> 0.0175s
-- initialize_schema_migrations_table()
   -> 0.0005s
-- assume_migrated_upto_version(20121114110230," ])
